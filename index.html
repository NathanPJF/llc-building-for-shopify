                A theme's purpose is to display your store's products, collections, pages, and blogs in
                an interesting way.  And each theme has its own way of doing this.

                You aren't limited to one theme, but keep in mind that switching themes will often require
                you spend some time learning the new theme and doing a bit of setup.

            ##Referencing CSS - Inline & Internal

            There are three ways to include (otherwise known as *referencing*) CSS in an HTML page.


            ###**INLINE**

            Can be added to any HTML element using the `style` *attribute*.

            ``` &lt;p style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;I'm writing CSS!&lt;/p&gt; ```

            This technique is not as common because it's harder to maintain but it's good to know how it works, just in case.

            ###INTERNAL

            Uses `&lt;style&gt;` and is included in the `&lt;head&gt;` element.

            ```
            &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;style&gt; h1 { font-size: 16px; } &lt;/style&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;
            &lt;body&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm still writing CSS!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt;
            ```
            This method is preferred over *inline* css, however it is still inefficient because if you had multiple web pages, the style block and any revisions would have to be replicated on every single page.

            ###EXTERNAL

            CSS is written in a separate stylesheet file. The **external** method is most widely used.

            A separate file with a `.css` extension is linked to the HTML file. This method is recommended in most cases because it separates the CSS from the HTML document. The link to the stylesheet is referenced in the `&lt;head&gt;` on any page where these styles need to be included. Only the CSS file needs to be updated rather than the CSS block on every single page. Referenced in the head element with a `&lt;link&gt;` tag and two **attributes**, `rel` and `href`. Just like creating links, the value of the `href` points to the location of the stylesheet. Though it is not required, css files are often saved in a css folder for organization, so make sure the file path points to the appropriate directory. The `rel` attribute describes the relationship.

            ```
            &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
                &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/style.css&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;
            ```

            **Pro tip!** Sublime Text shortcut: type &quot;link&quot; + tab key.

                You now seem to have the choice between customizing one template if a bunch
                of conditional statements, or to make a bunch of unique templates.

                You wouldn't want to make a bunch of unique ones, because maybe you want some
                of those conditional rules to apply to ALL product web pages.

                Alternate templates are best served when there are drastic differences in
                the page layout.

            * There's [a cool tutorial online](https://docs.shopify.com/support/your-store/products/how-do-i-add-tabs-to-product-descriptions) on how to add product tabs to a page.
            * BUT, no where does it say to make an alternate template, so merchants get in
            scenarios where they don't want tabs on every product.
            * Do exercise with only mentors help at first - being able to follow online tutorials is a skill.
