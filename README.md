### Building a web store with Shopify and Liquid

You've been thinking about ecommerce and wondering how you can use your skills to help people (or you!) sell cool stuff online.  In this workshop, we will show you how to customize online stores on the Shopify platform and give you the tools needed to make a business out of it.
 
Shopify's ecommerce solution already powers over 300,000 stores across the globe. Knowing how to customize themes on Shopify gives web designers/developers a desirable set of skills that they can use to grow their business. 

Do you want more control over how you show collections on the homepage? Need to show a coupon code for any product that is part of this season's Winter Solstice collection?  This workshop will teach you all you need to know to make that happen.

### What will you learn?

In this workshop, we'll discuss how you can use **Liquid**, Shopify's nifty templating language, to pull information from your store and alter the webpage layout.  You can also open a [free Partner account](https://www.shopify.com/partners), which you can use during and after the workshop to work on Shopify projects of your own. 
 
We'll start with an overview of Shopify's theme environment and best practices in making customizations.  From there you'll learn how to make alternative templates for your store's products and pages to provide more variety in your store's look. 
 
By the end of the day, your will have the foundational skills to transform an "out-of-the box template" into a custom site that reflects your design and how you want to run your store.

### Is this workshop for you?

This workshop has been designed for learners with basic HTML & CSS knowledge. Previous participation in a Ladies Learning Code Intro to HTML & CSS workshop is strongly recommended to get the most out of this workshop. 

You'll also need a Partner account to set up a development Shopify store to work on during this workshop. If you don't have one already, [click here to open a free Partner account](https://www.shopify.com/partners). You will need a Paypal account to signup, but thatâ€™s only so you can get paid (Shopify offers a revenue share to Partners that create stores on the Shopify platform). Workshop participants will be given demo products for their store on the day of the workshop.
