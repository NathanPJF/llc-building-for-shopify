Thanks for registering for the upcoming Ladies Learning Code workshop! There is no need to print a ticket or confirmation - we'll check you in electronically the day of the workshop.

We want to be able to dive right in and start learning at the workshop so there are a few things you need to prepare in advance below. Reminder, this workshop is BYOL so be sure to bring a laptop, power cord and computer mouse (if you're more comfortable using one than a trackpad).

HOW TO PREPARE:

1. Download the learner materials here:https://github.com/ladieslearningcode/llc-building-for-shopify/archive/master.zip
2. Set up a FREE Shopify Partner account:http://www.shopify.ca/partners
This will let you setup testing stores with no expiration date. An email associated with a PayPal account is required.
* Alternatively, you can setup a free 14-day trial store athttp://www.shopify.ca. After the trial period, you will be asked to switch to a paid plan.

That's it! If you have any questions or comments there will be mentors available to help you on the day of the workshop. 
Looking forward to seeing you at the workshop!

The Ladies Learning Code Team
